| Method        | Description                                                                                                     |

| map()         | Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.      |
| filter()      | Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.                  |
| slice()       | Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.                                        |
| concat()      | Merges two or more arrays and returns a new array.                                                              |
| reduce()      | Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.         |
| every()       | Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.                     |
| some()        | Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.           |
| find()        | Returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.               |
| findIndex()   | Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.               |
| indexOf()     | Returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.         |
| lastIndexOf() | Returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.          |
| includes()    | Determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate. |
| toString()    | Returns a string representing the specified array and its elements.                                             |
| join()        | Joins all elements of an array into a string.                                                                   |
